### [ANN - Artificial Neural Network](https://github.com/Ysbail/Deep-Learning-Practice/tree/master/ANN)

The aim of this project is to check which of the bank's clients want to stay and which of them may resign from services.
<br>Folder contains basic Artificial Neural Network algorithm. To preprocess data, check accuracy and confusion matrix I am using sklearn packages, to build neural network I am using keras with tensorflow.

### [CNN - Convolutional Neural Network](https://github.com/Ysbail/Deep-Learning-Practice/tree/master/Convolutional_Neural_Networks)

This convolutional neural network is designed to learn how to classify animal pictures - to distinguish whether there is a cat or a dog in the picture.
<br>I use the keras library in conjunction with tensorflow to process data.
